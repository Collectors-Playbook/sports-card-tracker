# üîç Advanced Text Extraction System

## Overview

The Sports Card Tracker now features a sophisticated text extraction system that simulates real-world OCR (Optical Character Recognition) behavior with realistic patterns, errors, and region-based parsing.

## Key Features

### üìç Position-Based Extraction

The system analyzes text by its position on the card:

- **Top Region**: Brand names, set information, grading labels
- **Middle Region**: Player names (usually largest text), team names, special features
- **Bottom Region**: Card numbers, serial numbers, copyright info

### üéØ Confidence Scoring

Each text region has a confidence score (0-100%):
- **95%+**: Very high confidence (grading info, card numbers)
- **90-94%**: High confidence (brand names, player names)
- **85-89%**: Good confidence (team names, stats)
- **Below 85%**: Review recommended

### üî§ OCR Error Simulation

Realistic OCR errors are simulated:
- Character confusion (O/0, I/1/l, S/5, B/8)
- Spacing errors (extra spaces, merged characters)
- Case variations (UPPERCASE, lowercase mixing)
- Common substitutions (rn‚Üím, ll‚ÜíII, vv‚Üíw)

### üìä Pattern Recognition

Advanced pattern matching for:
- **Stats**: AVG, HR, RBI, PPG, RPG, APG, TD, YDS
- **Fractions**: Serial numbers (25/99, 1/1)
- **Years**: 1989, 2023-24
- **Card Numbers**: #123, RC-45, US175
- **Set Info**: BASE SET, INSERT, PARALLEL, SP

## Text Extraction Templates

### Sports Cards
1. **Modern Cards** (2020+)
   - High-resolution text
   - Multiple parallels
   - Serial numbering
   - Social media handles

2. **Vintage Cards** (Pre-2000)
   - Simpler layouts
   - Career stats
   - Basic player info

3. **Graded Cards**

- **Other TCGs**: Mana cost, abilities, rarity

## Extraction Process

### 1. Text Region Detection
```typescript
const regions = [
  { text: "2023 Topps Chrome", position: "top", confidence: 0.95 },
  { text: "RONALD ACU√ëA JR.", position: "middle", confidence: 0.92, fontSize: "large" },
  { text: "Braves", position: "middle", confidence: 0.94 },
  { text: "#100", position: "bottom", confidence: 0.96 }
];
```

### 2. Text Cleaning
- Remove extra whitespace
- Fix OCR errors
- Normalize quotes and dashes
- Handle special characters

### 3. Context-Aware Parsing
- Player names from largest bold text
- Teams from medium text near player
- Card numbers from bottom regions
- Years from date patterns

### 4. Validation
- Year range checking (1900-current+1)
- Serial number logic (current ‚â§ total)
- Field completeness
- Pattern consistency

## Enhanced Features

### üö® Warning System
- Low confidence regions
- Missing important fields
- Validation errors
- OCR uncertainty indicators

### üìù Field Detection Priority
1. **Critical** (20 points): Player name
2. **Important** (15 points): Year, Brand
3. **Standard** (10 points): Card number
4. **Helpful** (5-8 points): Team, Category, Set
5. **Bonus** (3-5 points): Features, Serial numbers

### üé® Visual Feedback

#### Confidence Levels
- üü¢ **High**: Green indicator, 80%+ score
- üü° **Medium**: Yellow indicator, 60-79% score
- üî¥ **Low**: Red indicator, below 60% score

#### Detection Analysis
- Fields detected counter
- Missing fields list
- Warning messages
- Validation errors

## Advanced Mode

Shows detailed extraction information:
- Raw OCR text with regions
- Text cleaning transformations
- Pattern matches found
- Validation results
- Confidence calculations

## Error Handling

### Common OCR Errors
1. **Character Substitution**
   - O ‚Üî 0 (zero/oh confusion)
   - I ‚Üî 1 ‚Üî l (one/I/l confusion)
   - S ‚Üî 5 (S/five confusion)

2. **Spacing Issues**
   - Extra spaces: "M IKE TROUT"
   - Missing spaces: "MikeTrout"
   - Line breaks: "MIKE\nTROUT"

3. **Case Problems**
   - All caps: "MIKE TROUT"
   - Mixed case: "mIKE tROUT"
   - Inconsistent: "Mike TROUT"

### Recovery Strategies
- Fuzzy matching for known players/teams
- Pattern-based correction
- Context-aware parsing
- Confidence-weighted selection

## Best Practices
