# Multi-User Support Implementation

## Overview
The Sports Card Tracker application now supports multiple users, where each user has their own card collection. The admin has access to view and manage all users' data.

## Key Changes

### 1. Database Schema Update
- Added `userId` field to all cards
- Created compound indexes for efficient filtering: `[userId+year]`, `[userId+category]`
- Implemented database migration to add userId to existing cards

### 2. Card Operations
All card operations now filter by the current user's ID:
- `getAllCards()` - Returns only cards belonging to the current user
- `addCard()` - Automatically sets userId from auth state
- `updateCard()` - Maintains existing userId
- `deleteCard()` - Only deletes if card belongs to current user

### 3. Admin Features
Admin users (role === 'admin') have special privileges:
- Can view statistics for all users
- See per-user card counts and total values
- Can clear data for specific users
- Export functionality includes user information

### 4. Authentication Integration
- User ID is retrieved from auth state stored in localStorage
- Legacy cards are assigned to 'legacy-user' ID during migration
- All new cards automatically get the current user's ID

### 5. Backup/Restore
- Backup format now includes userId for each card
- Backups are user-specific (only current user's cards)
- Restore maintains userId from backup or uses current user

## Testing the Implementation

1. **As a Regular User:**
   - Login and add some cards
   - Verify you only see your own cards
   - Try backup/restore functionality

2. **As an Admin:**
   - Login with admin role
   - Navigate to Admin Dashboard
   - View per-user statistics
   - Test user data management features

3. **Multi-User Scenario:**
   - Create multiple user accounts
   - Add cards to each account
   - Verify data isolation between users
   - Test admin can see all users' data

## Security Considerations
- Users can only access their own cards
- Admin role required for viewing all users' data
- Database operations enforce userId filtering
- Backup/restore maintains user ownership

## Future Enhancements
- User profile management
- Sharing collections between users
- User-specific settings and preferences
- Collection comparison features
